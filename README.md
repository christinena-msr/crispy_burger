# Crispy Burger App

## Overview

Welcome to the crispy burger app "Eat-Da-Burger"!

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Instructions

Here is the url for the heroku-deployed app: [Eat-Da-Burger](https://murmuring-taiga-54595.herokuapp.com/)

2. Your new burger should show up under "Waiting Area" with a button next to it called "Devour It!"

3. To consume a burger, simply click on the adjacent "Devour It" button.

4. Consumed burgers will show up under "Burgers Consumed".

5. Add and consume as many burgers as you like!
